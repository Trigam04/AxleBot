## What is it
The greatest, fastest, and smartest discord bot. It contains a [state-of-the-art QR command](https://github.com/Trigam04/AxleBot/blob/master/commands/qr.js), [some classic moderation commands](https://github.com/Trigam04/AxleBot/blob/master/commands/ban.js) and some [randomized commands](https://github.com/Trigam04/AxleBot/blob/master/commands/dice.js) for when you need to settle something with friends. Maybe you just wanna have fun and search something on the Geometry Dash servers, [it can do that too](https://github.com/Trigam04/AxleBot/blob/master/commands/gd.js).

## The AxleBot Experience

Axle isn't just 100% utility, it still has a sense of humor. Laugh at your friends as they take the [best selfie ever](https://github.com/Trigam04/AxleBot/blob/master/commands/selfie.js) or just sit down and [fetch a dank meme](https://github.com/Trigam04/AxleBot/blob/master/commands/meme.js) without even having to open a new tab. Axle isn't just your everyday Discord bot, it's an entire experience.

## Speak your voice

When it comes to Axle, your voice matters. Send me a DM using @Trigam#3053 on Discord if you have any suggestions or if you find a bug, you can also leave your feedback in the support server, joined by using the [invite command](https://github.com/Trigam04/AxleBot/blob/master/commands/invite.js). Also, feel free to fork this repo and add your own commands. Axle is your canvas and your keyboard is the paintbrush. Paint your wildest dreams and anything else. For some bots, the sky is the limit but with Axle you can reach for the stars!

## All in One

No need for dozens of bots cluttering up your member list when Axle does it all. From moderation to urban dictionary searches and anything, Axle can do it all and does it in style. With over 59 lines of code just in the ban command, you know that this bot has been made for you. Personalized to be simple and easy to use without being abstract and vague.
